# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Project Is

**Rhabdomancer** is a headless IDA 9.x plugin (written in Rust) that locates calls to potentially insecure API functions in binary files. It uses `idalib` — Rust bindings to the IDA SDK — and requires a valid IDA installation to build and run.

## Build Requirements

- IDA 9.x installation with `IDADIR` environment variable set
- LLVM/Clang (required by `idalib` for bindgen)
- Rust (edition 2024)

The `build.rs` script uses `idalib-build` to auto-configure IDA SDK linkage. It emits a warning (but does not fail) if `IDADIR` is unset.

## Commands

```bash
# Build
cargo build --release --locked     # optimized (LTO, stripped, O3)
cargo build --locked               # debug build

# Test (uses a custom harness, not the standard Rust test framework)
cargo test --test tests --locked

# Lint & format (CI enforces these as errors)
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings

# Documentation (CI enforces this as an error via RUSTDOCFLAGS=-D warnings)
cargo doc --locked

# Dependency vulnerability audit (CI enforces this; requires cargo-audit)
cargo audit
```

CI's own `test` step only runs `cargo test --no-run` — a compile-only smoke check. The real integration suite in `tests/main.rs` needs a working IDA installation, which CI runners don't have, so it only runs locally.

## Architecture

Three source files:

- **`src/main.rs`** — CLI entry point. Parses a single binary path argument, calls `force_batch_mode()` to suppress IDA UI, then delegates to `lib::run()`.
- **`src/lib.rs`** — Core analysis logic. Public entry point: `run(filepath: impl AsRef<Path>) -> anyhow::Result<BookmarkIndex>`. Key types:
  - `KnownBadFunctions`: Loads `conf/rhabdomancer.toml`, normalizes function names for matching.
  - `BadFunctions<'a>`: Scans the opened IDB for calls to bad functions and annotates them with IDA bookmarks and inline comments (`[BAD 0]`/`[BAD 1]`/`[BAD 2]`).
  - `Priority` enum: `High`/`Medium`/`Low` — maps to BAD 0/1/2 via `#[repr(u8)]`; has `code()`, `tag_prefix()`, and `description()` helpers.
  - `traverse_xrefs()`: Iteratively walks cross-references using an explicit `Vec` stack. Handles `.plt` thunk indirection for ELF binaries.
  - `is_in_plt()`: Checks whether an address falls within a `.plt` segment.
  - `normalize_name()`: Strips leading dots/underscores from function names for cross-platform matching.
- **`tests/main.rs`** — Integration test with three scenarios against `tests/data/ls`:
  1. Default config: asserts exactly 86 marked locations, then verifies bookmark count, that every bookmark description starts with `[BAD `, comment count, and that every comment starts with `[BAD `.
  2. Idempotency: second run on the same IDB must return 0 new marks.
  3. Custom config via `RHABDOMANCER_CONFIG`: writes a minimal TOML to `tests/data/custom.toml`, asserts exactly 13 marks, and checks all bookmarks start with `[BAD 1]` (medium priority). Also exercises `normalize_name` since the custom config includes decorated names (`_fwrite`, `.memset`).
  - Uses a `show_everything()` helper that enables hidden comments/functions/instructions/segments before checking bookmark and comment content.

## Configuration

All "bad" functions are defined in `conf/rhabdomancer.toml`, grouped into `high`, `medium`, and `low` arrays. The config path can be overridden with the `RHABDOMANCER_CONFIG` environment variable. The loader uses the `config` crate with serde deserialization.

## Lint Policy

The workspace `Cargo.toml` enables aggressive lints. Notably forbidden everywhere except tests:

- `unwrap`, `expect`, `panic`, `todo`, `unimplemented`, `unreachable`, `dbg_macro`
- Unsafe blocks require a `reason` attribute

Use `#[expect(clippy::some_lint, reason = "...")]` to locally suppress a specific lint anywhere it genuinely cannot be avoided — in both library code and tests. Examples already in the codebase: `as_conversions` (casting `u8` repr), `shadow_reuse` (rebinding a variable for normalization), `arithmetic_side_effects` (usize counter), `else_if_without_else` (empty else branch), `panic_in_result_fn` (test assertions). `env::set_var`/`remove_var` are `unsafe` in Rust edition 2024; wrap them in `unsafe {}` with a `// Safety:` comment explaining the single-threaded context, as the existing test does.

## IDA Integration Notes

- `IDB::open_with(path, true, true)` opens or creates an `.i64` IDB file with auto-analysis enabled and the database kept after closing.
- `idalib::force_batch_mode()` must be called before opening any database (suppresses IDA UI).
- Annotation is idempotent — existing bookmarks/comments are not duplicated.
- `.plt` sections in ELF binaries require following one level of thunk indirection to reach the real import; `traverse_xrefs` handles this.

## CI Workflows

- **`build.yml`** — lint/build/test matrix across Linux, macOS, and Windows, plus a `zizmor` job that audits `.github/workflows/*.yml` for security issues (credential handling, injection, etc.).
- **`doc.yml`** — builds rustdoc and pushes it to the `gh-pages` branch on `v*` tags; its `checkout` step needs persisted git credentials to `git push` later, so it carries a `# zizmor: ignore[artipacked]` suppression comment.
- To suppress a specific zizmor finding, add an inline `# zizmor: ignore[<rule-id>]` comment on the flagged step with a short justification, rather than disabling the rule globally.
