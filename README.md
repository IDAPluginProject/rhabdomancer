Rhabdomancer is a blazing fast IDA headless plugin that locates calls to potentially insecure API functions in
a binary file. Auditors can backtrace from these candidate points to find pathways allowing access to untrusted input.

## Features

- Blazing fast, headless user experience courtesy of IDA 9.x and idalib-rs Rust bindings.
- Support for C/C++ binary targets compiled for any architecture implemented by IDA.
- Bad API function call locations are printed to stdout and marked in the IDB.
- Known bad API functions are grouped in tiers of badness to help prioritize the audit work.
  - [BAD 0] High priority - Functions that are generally considered insecure.
  - [BAD 1] Medium priority - Interesting functions that should be checked for insecure use cases.
  - [BAD 2] Low priority - Code paths involving these functions should be carefully checked.
- The list of known bad API functions can be easily customized by editing `conf/rhabdomancer.toml`.

## Installing

The easiest way to get the latest release is via [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rhabdomancer):

1. Download, install, and configure IDA (see <https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro>).
2. Install LLVM/Clang (see <https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html>).
3. On Linux/macOS, install as follows:
   ```sh
   export IDADIR=/path/to/ida # if not set, the build script will check common locations
   cargo install rhabdomancer --locked
   ```
   On Windows, instead, use the following commands:
   ```powershell
   $env:LIBCLANG_PATH="\path\to\clang+llvm\bin"
   $env:PATH="\path\to\ida;$env:PATH"
   $env:IDADIR="\path\to\ida" # if not set, the build script will check common locations
   cargo install rhabdomancer --locked
   ```

## Compiling

Alternatively, you can build from [source](https://github.com/0xdea/rhabdomancer):

1. Download, install, and configure IDA (see <https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro>).
2. Install LLVM/Clang (see <https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html>).
3. On Linux/macOS, compile as follows:
   ```sh
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/0xdea/rhabdomancer
   cd rhabdomancer
   export IDADIR=/path/to/ida # if not set, the build script will check common locations
   cargo build --release --locked
   ```
   On Windows, instead, use the following commands:
   ```powershell
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/0xdea/rhabdomancer
   cd rhabdomancer
   $env:LIBCLANG_PATH="\path\to\clang+llvm\bin"
   $env:PATH="\path\to\ida;$env:PATH"
   $env:IDADIR="\path\to\ida" # if not set, the build script will check common locations
   cargo build --release --locked
   ```

## Usage

1. Make sure IDA is properly configured with a valid license.
2. Customize the list of known bad API functions in `conf/rhabdomancer.toml` if needed. You can override the default
   configuration file location by setting the `RHABDOMANCER_CONFIG` environment variable.
3. Make sure the `IDADIR` environment variable is set if your IDA installation is in a non-standard location.
4. Run as follows:
   ```sh
   rhabdomancer <binary_file>
   ```
   Any existing `.i64` IDB file will be updated; otherwise, a new IDB file will be created.
5. Open the resulting `.i64` IDB file with IDA.
6. Select `View` > `Open subviews` > `Bookmarks`
7. Enjoy your results conveniently collected into an IDA window.

> [!NOTE]
> Rhabdomancer also adds comments at marked call locations.

## Changelog

- [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/0xdea/rhabdomancer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## TODO

- Further enrich the known bad API function list (see <https://github.com/0xdea/semgrep-rules>).
- Consider broadening the scope of normalization in `normalize_name` to account for more cases.
- Implement a basic ruleset in the style of [VulFi](https://github.com/Accenture/VulFi)
  and [VulnFanatic](https://github.com/Martyx00/VulnFanatic).
